## Questions
- A GET route `/book` which accepts optional book id and the book id must be decimal number only.
- A REDIRECT route from `/trucks` to `/vans` and redirect type is permanent.
- A GET route `/mailto` which accepts an optional parameter recipient (string), the recipient default is `admin`.
- A POST route `/register` which will handle with name and password, the callback function should print signup form name and password. CSRF is required in the form.
- A GET route `/house` which accepts a house type value which must be `attached` or `detached`.
- A GET route `/chart` which accepts a required parameter - chart type, `bar`, `line` and `pie`, and name the route to `chart`. Return these 3 chart types URL via `route` helper function.
- 2 GET routes `/fruit/apple` and `/fruit/orange`, you must define them by using route prefix.
- A PUT route `/profile/update` and give a name `profile.update`
- A GET route `/profile/edit` with a blade file `profile`. The form method must be PUT, action url is `profile/update` but it must be generated by route helper with route name (profile_update), there is only one field in the form - email. Note that CSRF is required. Finally print the submitted email address.
